Ayodhya (impregnable), the city of the gods, consists of eight circles (also cycles) and nine entrances;
within it there is the golden treasure-dome, the celestial world, ever-illuminated with light (north pole).
Whoever knows it as the Creator's city ever surrounded with nectar
will have long life, fame, and offspring bestowed on him, by Brahma (the sun), and Brahma (the moon).
Into this city ever shining, moving, and pervaded with Yasas (fame and lustre),
the Creator has entered.

Eight-wheeled, nine-doored, is the impregnable stronghold of the gods; in that is a golden vessel, heaven-going (swarga), covered with light
